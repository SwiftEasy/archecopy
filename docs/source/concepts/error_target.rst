Error Target
============

Here, we provide detailed guidance on how errors are handled and structured within Arch. 
Error handling is a crucial part of making sure that applications and functions are robust, resilient, and clear in their failure states. 
This page will explore the concept of error target, define how errors are represented, and provide best practices for dealing with errors efficiently.

Overview
--------

**Error targets** are designed to capture and manage specific issues or exceptions that occur during a function or system's execution. 
Instead of leaving errors unaddressed—potentially resulting in crashes or undefined behaviors—error targets offer a structured approach to handle, log, and respond to various issues.

These endpoints receive errors forwarded from Arch when issues arise, such as improper function/API calls, guardrail violations, or other processing errors. 
The errors are communicated to the application via headers like ``X-Arch-[ERROR-TYPE]``, enabling it to respond appropriately and handle errors gracefully.


Key Concepts
------------

**Error Type**: Categorizes the nature of the error, such as "ValidationError" or "RuntimeError." These error types help in identifying what kind of issue occurred and provide context for troubleshooting.

**Error Message**: A clear, human-readable message describing the error. This should provide enough detail to inform users or developers of the root cause or required action.

**Target Function**: The specific function or operation where the error occurred. Understanding where the error happened helps with debugging and pinpointing the source of the problem.

**Parameter-Specific Errors**: Errors that arise due to invalid or missing parameters when invoking a function. These errors are critical for ensuring the correctness of inputs.

**Error Code**: A numeric or string-based code that uniquely identifies the error. Error codes standardize error communication, making it easier to handle different error types programmatically.


Configuration Example
--------------------------

Errors are typically structured as JSON objects or in a format that defines key fields like:

.. literalinclude:: includes/arch_config.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 40-43


Best Practices and Tips
-----------------------

- **Clear Error Messages**: Ensure that error messages are user-friendly and provide enough information for both users and developers to understand the cause of the issue.

- **Categorize Errors**: Use distinct error types for different kinds of failures (e.g., validation errors, runtime errors) to simplify error handling and debugging.

- **Graceful Degradation**: If an error occurs, fail gracefully by providing fallback logic or alternative flows when possible. Avoid sudden application crashes.

- **Use Error Codes Consistently**: Define and document error codes to ensure that they are used consistently across the system.

- **Log Errors**: Always log errors on the server side for later analysis. Logs should contain useful information like the error type, message, stack trace (if available), and the state of the system when the error occurred.

- **Client-Side Handling**: Make sure the client can interpret error responses and provide meaningful feedback to the user. Clients should not display raw error codes or stack traces but rather handle them gracefully.
