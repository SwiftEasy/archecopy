Getting Started
================

This section gets you started with a very simple configuration and provides some example configurations.

.. sidebar:: Pre-requisites
    
    In order for you to get started, please make sure that `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_ 
    and `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ are installed locally.

    As the examples use the pre-built `Arch Docker images <https://hub.docker.com/r/katanemo/arch>`_, 
    they should work on the following architectures:

        - x86_64
        - ARM 64


The fastest way to get started using Arch is installing `pre-built binaries <https://hub.docker.com/r/katanemo/arch>`_.
You can also build it from source.
