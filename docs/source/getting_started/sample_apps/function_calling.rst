Function Calling (Agentic) Apps
===============================

Building something more than a summary/qa experience requires giving users access to you data and APIs - via prompts.
Arch enables that use case by offering a capability called "Function Calling". Arch extracts critical imformation
from a prompt and can match the intent of the user to an API or business function hosted in your application.
